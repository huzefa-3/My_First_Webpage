    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Intern at IIT Jodhpur</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Implemented Simrank in C++ and optimized it with OpenMP for parallel computation, scaling the original algorithm to be
                            1900x faster from a fourth-order initial time complexity.</li>
                        <li>Scaled the graph size from an initial limit of 1,000 nodes and edge limit to 1 million nodes and 11 million edges, and presently
                            implementing the code on CUDA, which can potentially increase performance by 10x.</li>
                        <li>Observing the performance of our algorithm, we are planning for multiple research papers. After our first base paper, we
                            will scale it to SimRank on dynamically increasing graphs. </li>
                        <li>Applications include Recommendation systems, Social Network Analysis, Web Search and Link Analysis</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                   
                
                <li><b>Credit Card Fraud Detection</b>
                    <ol><li>Pre-processed imbalanced dataset through under-sampling, visualization, and standardization, preparing for machine learning
                        (ML) analysis.</li>
                        <li>Achieved highest accuracy (95%) using logistic regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM); Random Forest and XGBoost
                            achieved 94%.</li>
                        <li>Observed consistent cross-validation scores, indicating models avoid overfitting; tuned models consistently outperformed
                            defaults.</li>
                    </ol>
